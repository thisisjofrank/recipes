## Ingredients

* 300g of choy sum (this recpipe also works with pak choi, spinach, greens, tenderstem broccoli, whatever you can find)
* 2 spring onions
* 10g piece of ginger
* 1 red chilli pepper
* 4 tbsp cooking oil (vegetable or sunflower)
* 2 tbsp soy sauce

## Method

Wash and trim your veggies. Peel the ginger. Chop it into very thin slivers (lengthways). Chop the chilli in half long ways and remove the seeds, then chop it into fine slithers too (lengthways). Trim the spring onions and cop them into very find slivers to match the size of the ginger and chilli.

Boil a pan full of water. Once boiling, add the greens and boil for a minute or two (longer if using broccoli) until they lose their rawness. Drain and shake dry in a colander. Pile the veggies into a serving dish and pile the chilli, ginger and spring onion slivers on top of it.

Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat until sizzling. Pour the hot oil over the spring onions, ginger and chilli. It should sizzle dramatically and release the aromas of the seasoning.
Once it has finished sizzling, pour over the soy sauce and serve.
