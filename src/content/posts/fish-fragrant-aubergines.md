## Ingredients

* 2 Large aubergines
* Salt
* Oil for frying (sunflower, vegetable, etc)
* 2 tbsp Sichuanese chilli bean paste
* 1 tbsp grated/chopped ginger
* 1 tbsp pressed/chopped garlic
* 150ml chicken or veggie stock
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp cornflour mixed with 1tbsp cold water
* a healthy splash of Chinkiang vinegar
* 1 finely sliced spring onion (just the green bits)

## Method

Slice the auberines into batons that are approx 6cm by 2cm by 2cm. Place the batons in a colander or bowl and sprinkle liberally with salt to draw out the liquid. Leave for at least 15 mins while you prepare the other ingredients.

Grate or chop the ginger and press or chop the garlic. Prepare your stock and roue of water and cornflour. Chop the spring onion greens into thin rounds. Place all of these aside.

In a wok or large frying pan heat a generous quantity of oil and fry the aubergines until they are soft and floppy.
Once they have softened, add the chilli bean paste and fry until the oil in the pan looks red and the paste becomes fragrant.

Add the ginger and garlic and continue ot stir fry until you can smell their aromas, and they look cooked.

Add the stock and sugar and stir well. Let the aubergines absorb the flavours. Add the flour roux and let the sauce thicken. Add vinegar to taste (lots!) and stir it in well.

Serve in a bowl and sprinkle over the spring onions.
