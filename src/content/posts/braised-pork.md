## Ingredients

* 500g pork belly
* 2 tbsp cooking oil (sunflower, vegetable, groundnut, etc)
* 50g ginger
* 1 spring onion
* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 500ml pork or chicken stock
* 3-4 Star anise
* 3 bits of cassia bark or 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 2 tbsp caster sugar

## Method

Cut the pork into 2-3cm chunks. Cut the ginger into slices approx 2mm thick (don't peel the ginger). Chop the white from the green of the spring onion. Chop the white up into small rounds.

Pour the oil into a cast iron pot, slow cooker or saucepan and heat over a high flame. Fry the ginger and spring onion whites until their aromas are released. Add the pork and continue to fry for a couple more minutes. Pour over the Shaoxing wine and the stock. Add in the star anise and cassia bark, the soy sauce and the sugar and give it a good mix. 

Turn the flame down to low and simmer for at least an hour an a half. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't boil dry or burn on the bottom, add more water if necessary. 

Chop the spring onion greens and mix them in before serving.
