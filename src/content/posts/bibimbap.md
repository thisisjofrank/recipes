## Ingredients

* 1 serving of white rice per person (60-90g per person)
* Beef steak (1 per person) (doesn't have to be a fancy steak) (or beef mince will work too)
* Gochujang (Korean chilli paste)
* 1 tsp sugar
* Soy sauce
* Roasted sesame oil
* Pureed garlic (I use the stuff from a jar or tube for this recipe)
* Carrots (1 per person)
* Cucumber (a 4cm chunk per person)
* Beansprouts
* Spinach
* Sesame seeds (optional)
* Eggs (one per person, optional)

## Method

**Warning ,this recipe uses many many pans!**

### Cook your rice

You can cook the rice however you like, this is how i do it:  
Pour your rice portions into a bowl, cover the rice in water, then add half that amount of water again. Microwave the rice on high for 5 minutes, give it a stir. Microwave it on medium for 5 minutes, give it a stir, microwave it on low for 5 minutes. Done!

### Marinade the beef

In a bowl, mix a tablespoon of Gochujang, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, a teaspoon of pureed garlic, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of sugar. Chop the beef steak into strips (1cm by 5cm ish) and mix it into the marinade you just made. Leave it to sit for at least half an hour. (You can prep the other ingredients during this time).

### Prepare the veggies

Chop the carrot and cucumber into matchsticks. Set aside.

Heat the beansprouts in a pan with a teaspoon of sesame oil, a teaspoon of soy sauce, a half teaspoon of garlic puree and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

Heat the spinach in a pan until it wilts (about 5 mins). Once it has wilted, tip the spinach into a colander and pour cold water over it (this is called blanching). Squeeze the spinach to remove excess water, chop it roughly, mix it in a bowl with a teaspoon of sesame oil, a teaspoon of soy sauce, a half teaspoon of garlic puree and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Set aside.

### Mix the sauce

In a small serving bowl mix together a generous tablespoon of Gochujang, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, a teaspoon of pureed garlic, a teaspoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of sugar or honey.

### Fry an egg

Fry the eggs.

### Put it together!

In a generously sized bowl scoop your rice portion, around that position the veggies, so that they look a little like the picture above. In the center, on top of the rice, place the beef. On top of that, the fried egg. Serve with the sauce on the side. To eat, spoon on the sauce to your taste and mix the whole thing together.
